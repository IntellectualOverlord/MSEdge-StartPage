# cool-newtab
This is a newtab page/ startpage designed for use with chrome/chromium, but it will still work with others. cool-newtab comes in two flavors:
* Dark
* Light

---

## Install
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/IntellectualOverlord/cool-newtab`.
2. Unzip it, and copy either (or both) dark/light folders to a location you can access easily, but won't accidentally delete.
3. Either install the extention [newtab page in chrome](https://github.com/jimschubert/NewTab-Redirect) for chrome/ chromium and follow those directions, or navigate to the settings of your browser and set either on of the index.html files as your homepage.

### New Tab Behaviour
I have made it so that links open in the same the tab. I did this because I use the startpage in conjunction with another github project for changing your [newtab page in chrome](https://github.com/jimschubert/NewTab-Redirect)
